# List of critical bugs:
- Ticket's sprintID shouldn't have the **`NOT NULL`** constraint!
-  Fix how a ticket is assigned. Should an assignment be created everytime a ticket is created, and assignments be simply edited 
- On creating any handle errors if something already exists or some required field is missing or due to foreign-key conflits!
