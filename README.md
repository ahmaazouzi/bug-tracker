# A Not so Revolutionary Bug Tracker:
## Intro and Motivation:
- This project doesn't add anything to the world. It is a complete waste of humanity's time, but I need a job and I have nothing to show for it. I thought of populating my protfolio with a bunch of small half-bottomed "projects", but I came across this video by Bob Davis of *Code Foundery* and was intrigued by what he suggested:

[![The 1 coding project idea guaranteed to get you a Software Development job](https://img.youtube.com/vi/oC483DTjRXU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC483DTjRXU)
- The video suggests a bug tracker as one of the most effective projects a beginner or an intermediate developer can add to her portfolio. It is an application sophisticated enough to involve much of skills a typical web developer, especially a so-called "full stack developer", must have. It involves a data storage and management mechanism (a SQL database or otherwise), a backend mechanism for processing data, requests and responses, a frontend for allowing the user to interact with the application. It also involves authentication and authorization, implementing some form of business logic, extensive testing coverage.. etc. 
- The video suggests the use of the .NET environment to power the application.I don't know anything about .NET and C#, but I will try to learn more about it as I progress through building the suggested application and might even use it. In case I fail to like .NET, I might use node or Python Flask framework.
-  I am starting with the frontend and will use react and redux and probably graphQL. The first absolute step is to create a basic HTML mockup of the project's view and an initial mock json payload that simulates the data the view would be receiving from the server. The HTML mockup will be converted into a functional react view. Redux will be introduced as soon as react state management becomes annoying. If the react app is able to handle the simplified json payload, I will move to the back-end, start with a database and the models of the application.
